            <p class="sunText">
                The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence
                extends
                far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there
                would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun
                scattered across the Milky Way galaxy
            </p>

            <div class="mercuryDescription"> Mercury </div>
            <p class="mercuryText">
                The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence
                extends
                far beSun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury has
                very
                little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated
                by
                the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in
                craters. Mercury's egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.

            <div class="venusDescription"> Venus </div>
            <p class="venusText">
                >Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth,
                Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The scorched world has
                temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed
                mountains.
                Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.
            </p>


            <div class="earthDescription"> Earth </div>
            <p class="earthText">
                Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water - and life - makes it unique in our
                solar
                system. Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only
                on
                Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life - and lots of it.
            </p>

            <div class="marsDescription"> Mars </div>
            <p class="marsText">
                Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth, telescope observations show
                seasonally
                changing features and white patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright and
                dark
                areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could be a likely place for life-forms, and that
                water might exist in the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in 1965, many were
                shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later
                missions, however, have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and holds many
                mysteries
                yet to be solved.

            <div class="jupiterDescription"> Jupiter </div>
            <p class="jupiterText">
                The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter
                forms
                a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been
                about
                80 times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.
            </p>

            <div class="saturnDescription"> Saturn </div>
            <p class="saturnText">
                Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made
                mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the
                upper
                atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast
                winds,
                combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible
                in
                the atmosphere.
            </p>

            <div class="uranusDescription"> Uranus </div>
            <p class="uranusText">
                The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
                William
                Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one
                orbit.
            </p>

            <div class="neptuneDescription"> Neptune </div>
            <p class="neptuneText">
                Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every
                165
                years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. Interestingly,
                the
                unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year
                period out of every 248 Earth years
            </p>

            <div class="plutoDescription"> Pluto </div>
            <p class="plutoText">
                Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and long considered to be the ninth
                planet. But after the discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto was
                reclassified
                as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence of the origins of
                our
                solar system.
